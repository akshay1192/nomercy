1. No need of temp variable : array[j],array[j+1] = array[j+1],array[j]

2. String is sequence of bytes but traversing a string gives runes (UTF8 - int32)

3. *[]Node and  []*Node are two different things -

    *[]Node : Pointer to slice of node type struct
    []*Node : Slice having pointer of node type struct

4. Slice passed as value or pointer ?

5. Receiver methods can not change the base address inside that method

       func(s *[]type) test () {
           s = &xyz    // not allowed
       }

       you can append in the using pointers (base address), change values also (can be done without pointer)
