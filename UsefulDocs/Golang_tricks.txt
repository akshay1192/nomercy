1. No need of temp variable : array[j],array[j+1] = array[j+1],array[j]

2. String is sequence of bytes but traversing a string gives runes (UTF8 - int32)

    rune can be compared as an int32 as well as char
    Ex : char == 132    OR    char == 'a'      (where char is a rune)

    string([]rune) return string

3. *[]Node and  []*Node are two different things -

    *[]Node : Pointer to slice of node type struct
    []*Node : Slice having pointer of node type struct

4. Slice passed as value or pointer ?

5. Receiver methods can not change the base address inside that method

       func(s *[]type) test () {
           s = &xyz    // not allowed
       }

       you can append in the using pointers (base address), change values also (can be done without pointer)


6. Sorting : https://yourbasic.org/golang/how-to-sort-in-go/

7. Strings in golang are immutable. So, every time we add a new char/string to our already created string then
   a new copy is created with extra space to hold the incoming string/char ---- O(n2)

   instead use []rune to append and finally convert to string using string([]rune) ----- O(n)

   Ex : check palindrome check in algos folder
